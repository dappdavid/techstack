# Code review Checklist

- **Code style**
    - Does the code follow the project's coding standards and conventions?
    - Are the variable and function names descriptive and meaningful?
    - Is the code free of duplication or redundant elements?
    - Avoid unnecessary comments in code.
    - Is the code well-documented, including comments and inline documentation?
- **Tests**
    - do the tests adequately cover the functionality, including edge cases?
    - do the tests clear the minimum test coverage rate using a tool like jUnit or jaCoco
- **Clean code**
    - Is the code well-organized, concise and easy to understand?
    - Is the code located in the right file/folder/package?
    - Ensure the code follows appropriate error handling procedures
    - Optimize to use switch-case over multiple If-Else statements
    - Check if some common functionalities can be extracted
    - Check if refactoring can be done
    - Handle strings appropriately
        - If you need to perform a lot of operations on a [String](https://stackabuse.com/string-vs-stringbuilder-vs-stringbuffer-in-java/), use StringBuilder or StringBuffer.
    - Make sure it handles constants efficiently
        - Constants help improve memory as they are cached by the JVM.
        - For values that are reused across multiple places, create a constant file that holds static values.
        - Favor database-driven values over dynamic values.
        - Also, use ENUMs to group constants.
    - If there are existing utility/helper methods available, reuse it instead of reinventing the wheel.
    - Does this change add unwanted compile-time or run-time dependencies?
- **Clean architecture**
    - Does it follow the SOLID principles
    - Override hashCode when overriding equals
    - Validate that the code follows separation of concerns : different concerns or responsibilities should be separated into different modules or layers, rather than being mixed together
    - Does this change have any ramifications for other parts of the system, backward compatibility
    - Does the code rely on frameworks rather than custom logic when possible
    - Does the code follow good design practices, such as separation of concerns and modularity?
    - Will this code change will impact system performance in a negative way
- **Feature based points**
    - Does the code cover all the use cases as part of the user story or feature?
    - Are all the edge cases of the user story implemented and tested as part of the code change?
    - Is Acceptance criteria fulfilled as part of the user story?
- **API specific**
    - Is the API following good coding practices, such as using descriptive and meaningful variable names and adhering to a consistent code style
    - Is the API avoiding unnecessary code complexity?
    - Are the API methods and their dependencies appropriately tested, and are the test cases covering a wide range of input and edge cases?
    - Is the API handling errors and exceptions in a consistent and appropriate way, and are the error responses well-structured and meaningful?
- **Database**
    - Is the database access code using appropriate connection pooling and connection management techniques to ensure efficient use of resources and prevent resource exhaustion?
    - Is the database access code using appropriate exception handling and error handling techniques, and are errors and exceptions being logged and handled appropriately?
    - Are the database queries optimized for performance, and are they using appropriate indexing and other performance-enhancing techniques?
    - Is the database access code using appropriate transaction management techniques to ensure data consistency and integrity?
- **Security**
    - Make sure variables don’t cause memory leaks
    - Is the code properly encrypted and protected when handling sensitive data, such as passwords or personal information?
    - Is the code free of vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS)?
- **Documentation**
    - Is the associated documentation up-to-date and accurate?
